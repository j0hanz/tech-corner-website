## Security

### Django Axes

Django Axes is an essential security feature for our users, designed to protect against brute-force attacks by limiting the number of login attempts. Hereâ€™s why we chose to include Django Axes:

- **Security Enhancement**: By restricting the number of login attempts, we greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access via brute-force methods.
- **User Protection**: This ensures that legitimate users are protected from malicious login attempts.

If your account is locked due to multiple failed login attempts, it will automatically be reset after 30 minutes, allowing you to try logging in again.

#### Set Up Environment Variables in Django

1. **Create an `env.py` file:**
   - In the top-level directory of your Django app, create a new file named `env.py`.

2. **Import `os` in `env.py`:**
   ```python
   import os
   ```

3. **Set up necessary environment variables in `env.py`:**
   - Add a secret key:
     ```python
     os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'
     ```
   - Add the database URL:
     ```python
     os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'your_database_url'
     ```

4. **Update `settings.py` to use environment variables:**
   - Replace the value of the `SECRET_KEY` variable with:
     ```python
     SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
     ```
   - Change the value of the `DATABASES` variable to:
     ```python
     'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
     ```

5. **Modify the top of `settings.py`:**
   ```python
   from pathlib import Path
   import os
   import dj_database_url

   if os.path.isfile('env.py'):
       import env
   ```

---

#### Configure Heroku Environment Variables

1. **Navigate to the "Settings" tab in Heroku.**
2. **Open the "Config Vars" section and add environment variables:**

   - Add `SECRET_KEY` with the secret key value from your `env.py`.

---

#### Finalize Settings in Django

1. **Migrate the models to the new database connection:**
   - In your terminal, run:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

2. **Add static files settings in `settings.py`:**
   ```python
   STATIC_URL = '/static/'
   STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')]
   STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
   ```

3. **Update the templates directory in `settings.py`:**
   ```python
   TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
   ```

4. **Modify the `DIRS` key in the `TEMPLATES` variable in `settings.py`:**
   ```python
   'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR],
   ```

5. **Add Heroku to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` list:**
   - The format will be `your-app-name.herokuapp.com`, which you can copy from the Domains section in the Settings tab of your Heroku app.

---

#### Create Necessary Folders and Files

   - Add the following line to the `Procfile`:
     ```bash
     web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi
     ```

---

#### Deploy Your Changes

**Deploy Your App from Heroku:**
- Go to the "**Deploy**" tab in Heroku.
